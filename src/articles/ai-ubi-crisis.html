  <h2>The Great White Collar Exodus</h2>
  <p>Remember when we were told to learn to code? Well, AI just learned to code better. And faster. And without needing coffee breaks or mental health days. As our beloved tech overlords continue to automate everything from writing emails to writing code, we're left wondering: what's next for the generation that was promised a future of remote work and six-figure salaries?</p>

  <h2>The UBI Question</h2>
  <p>Elon Musk says we need Universal Basic Income. What he doesn't say is who's going to pay for it. The same tech companies automating our jobs? The same billionaires who keep finding new ways to avoid taxes? The same government that can't even agree on what day it is? It's like promising free pizza at a party but forgetting to order the pizza.</p>

  <h2>The Blue Collar Renaissance</h2>
  <p>But here's the plot twist: while AI is busy replacing white-collar jobs, it's having a harder time with the jobs that require actual physical presence. Plumbing, electrical work, carpentry – these are the new hot careers. Your coding bootcamp didn't prepare you for this, did it?</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Plumber</strong> - AI can't fix your toilet. Yet.</li>
    <li><strong>Electrician</strong> - Try explaining to an AI why the lights flicker when you turn on the microwave.</li>
    <li><strong>Carpenter</strong> - Good luck getting ChatGPT to build your deck.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Future is Blue Collar</h2>
  <p>So here's the deal: while the tech industry is busy automating itself into obsolescence, the trades are experiencing a renaissance. The jobs that require actual human presence, human judgment, and human problem-solving are becoming more valuable than ever.</p>

  <p>Maybe it's time to trade in your MacBook for a tool belt. After all, you can't automate a good handshake – or a well-built house.</p>
